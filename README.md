# SIGMA-Grade-Tracker-and-Dashboard
This is a file I made while teaching to track the grades in a visual way.
This will track practice paper and test grades against target grades, AND give you a summary of their best grade so far, most recent test score,  the average of their last 3 practice paper scores and a count of how many practice papers each pupil has done (all colour coded in relation to target grade).
For more info, see the first tab of the Excel file.
